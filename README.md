### Ever found a story so good that you immediately become a fan? But, Alas! the story is just a few minutes long. Fret not, for we have a novel idea to generate the prequels and sequels you deserve.




## Inspiration

Novels and stories bring joy to all people, be it a 7-year-old child or a 70-year-old person. Some stories have a very special place in our hearts: the stories that we heard from our grandparents. Some stories we find on the internet and immediately fall in love with. Sometimes we want to hear more stories like these, but we can't, maybe because we have lost the source or there simply aren't any. These stories that bring us joy inspired us to create "A Novel Idea (Anode)". 

## What it does

Anode has two sections.

**1. Generate a Sequel/Prequel**
       In this section, you can enter a link to a youtube video with a story or type a story and generate a prequel or sequel of the story.

**2. Generate a Novel**
       In this section, you can enter a title for a novel and Anode will generate the whole book.
       
**3. Generate a Bed Time Story**
       In this section, you can enter a title for a bed time story and a moral and Anode will generate the whole book.
